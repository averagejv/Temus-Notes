low to high fidelity ideas from paper drawings to AI

v0 by vercel or loveable or replit for making apps without coding

## the actual project
- make an app, any topic

## Setting up environment
- use google colab https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1n0lIK_KnE7Ga6NVFEZ7BGQCwfo5ulxiW?usp=sharing #edit changes will not be saved in this copy
- or set up environ with jupyter notebook

## to get key go to groq's website and make a key
- keep key private in google colab secrets on in .env file in python

## how to use the colab thing:
- run all of the code in order
- pass the name of the GROQ_API_KEY as the one placed in secrets
-   the system_prompt is a prompt given to the AI before the user_prompt is passed. It is the initial message to the API before the User prompt is executed and is usually used to let the LLM know the scope of its work
- temperature shows how predictable or unpredictable the output generated will be i.e. 0.1 is very predictable and 1 is very unpredictable (for general cases kept at around 0.5 for creativity sake)

- beautiful soup sounds tasty
